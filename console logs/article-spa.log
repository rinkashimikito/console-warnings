warning.js:33 Warning: RelayContainer: component `BlogPostIdentityLayout` was rendered with variables that differ from the variables used to fetch fragment `parent`. The fragment was fetched with variables `(not fetched)`, but rendered with variables `{}`. This can indicate one of two possibilities:
 - The parent set the correct variables in the query - `BlogPostIdentityLayout.getFragment('parent', {...})` - but did not pass the same variables when rendering the component. Be sure to tell the component what variables to use by passing them as props: `<BlogPostIdentityLayout ...  />`.
 - You are intentionally passing fake data to this component, in which case ignore this warning.

warning.js:33 Warning: Cannot update during an existing state transition (such as within `render` or another component's constructor). Render methods should be a pure function of props and state; constructor side-effects are an anti-pattern, but can be moved to `componentWillMount`.

The fragment was fetched with variables `(not fetched)`, but rendered with variables `{}`. This can indicate one of two possibilities:
