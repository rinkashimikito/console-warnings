warning.js:33 Warning: RelayContainer: component `HeaderLayout` was rendered with variables that differ from the variables used to fetch fragment `blog`. The fragment was fetched with variables `(not fetched)`, but rendered with variables `{}`. This can indicate one of two possibilities:
 - The parent set the correct variables in the query - `HeaderLayout.getFragment('blog', {...})` - but did not pass the same variables when rendering the component. Be sure to tell the component what variables to use by passing them as props: `<HeaderLayout ...  />`.
 - You are intentionally passing fake data to this component, in which case ignore this warning.
